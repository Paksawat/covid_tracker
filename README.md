 Live stats tracking for Covid 19
 ** The API used is no longer available and this tracker will show no data.  

A quick small project, made at the start op lockdown, to help me keep track of the situation. 

This could filter by country and show live stats of total Covid cases, active cases, recovered & deaths.
